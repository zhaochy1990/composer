# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

IMPORTANT RULES

- always do testing after any changes
- add testing once implemented new features

## Project Overview

Composer is an AI agent orchestration platform that turns work items into parallelized, workflow-driven coding tasks. It pairs a Rust backend (Axum + SQLite) with a React frontend, built to ship as a single binary via rust-embed.

## Commands

### Development
```bash
pnpm install                # Install all dependencies
pnpm run dev                # Run both Vite dev server (port 5173) and Cargo watch concurrently
pnpm run dev:web            # Vite dev server only (port 5173, proxies /api to :3000)
pnpm run dev:server         # Cargo watch on Rust crates only
```

### Build
```bash
pnpm run build              # Build both web and server
pnpm run build:web          # Vite production build → packages/web/dist/
pnpm run build:server       # Cargo release build → target/release/composer-server
```

### Test
```bash
pnpm run test:e2e           # Playwright E2E tests (headless)
pnpm run test:e2e:ui        # Playwright with UI
pnpm run test:e2e:headed    # Playwright with visible browser
cargo test                  # Rust unit tests
```

### Lint & Format
```bash
pnpm run lint               # ESLint on web package
pnpm run format             # Prettier + cargo fmt
```

### Type Generation
```bash
pnpm run generate-types     # Export Rust types → packages/web/src/types/generated.ts
```

## Architecture

### Monorepo Structure
- **Cargo workspace** (`crates/`): 7 Rust crates
- **pnpm workspace** (`packages/`): 1 React/TypeScript package

### Rust Crates (dependency order)
1. **api-types** — Shared structs/enums with `#[derive(TS)]` for TypeScript codegen via ts-rs
2. **config** — User configuration from `~/.composer/config.toml`, credentials, and path management
3. **db** — SQLx + SQLite layer (WAL mode). Migrations in `crates/db/migrations/`
4. **git** — Git worktree management for agent isolation (creates under `.composer/worktrees/`)
5. **executors** — Spawns Claude Code CLI processes, parses stream-JSON protocol, emits events
6. **services** — Business logic: TaskService, AgentService, SessionService, WorktreeService, EventBus
7. **server** — Axum HTTP server (port 3000), WebSocket hub, route handlers, embedded SPA serving

### Frontend (`packages/web/`)
- **React 18** with **TanStack Router** and **TanStack Query** for data fetching
- **Zustand** for client state, **shadcn/ui** (Radix + Tailwind) for components
- Path alias: `@/*` → `./src/*`
- Two main views: TaskBoard (kanban) and AgentPool (agent management)

### Data Flow
Frontend (React) → REST API (TanStack Query) → Axum routes → Services → DB + Executors + EventBus → WebSocket → Frontend

### Key Patterns
- **Rust→TS types**: Rust structs with `#[derive(TS)]` auto-generate `packages/web/src/types/generated.ts`
- **Event broadcasting**: tokio broadcast channel (EventBus) pushes `WsEvent` over WebSocket to frontend
- **Agent isolation**: Each agent session gets its own git worktree under `.composer/worktrees/`
- **Process management**: `AgentProcessManager` uses DashMap for lock-free tracking of spawned Claude Code processes
- **Single binary**: Production build embeds the React SPA into the Rust binary via rust-embed

### API Routes
All routes are under the Axum server at `:3000`:
- `/health` — Health check
- `/tasks` — CRUD + `/tasks/{id}/assign`, `/tasks/{id}/move`, `/tasks/{id}/sessions`
- `/agents` — CRUD + `/agents/{id}/health`, `/agents/discover`
- `/sessions` — Create, get, resume, logs
- `/worktrees` — List, delete
- `/ws` — WebSocket (bidirectional: WsCommand/WsEvent)

### Configuration (`crates/config/`)

Composer uses a layered configuration system. Precedence: **env var > `~/.composer/config.toml` > defaults**.

**`~/.composer/` directory structure:**
```
~/.composer/
├── config.toml          # Global user config
├── credentials.toml     # API keys (restricted permissions on Unix)
├── logs/                # Rotated server logs (when logging.log_to_file = true)
└── data/                # Runtime data (future use)
```

**Config sections & defaults:**
- `server.port` = 3000, `server.bind_address` = "127.0.0.1"
- `database.url_pattern` = "sqlite:composer.db?mode=rwc"
- `logging.level` = "composer=debug,tower_http=debug", `logging.log_to_file` = false
- `cors.origins` = [localhost:5173, localhost:3000 variants]

### Environment Variables
- `DATABASE_URL` — overrides `database.url_pattern`
- `CORS_ORIGINS` — overrides `cors.origins` (comma-separated)
- `RUST_LOG` — overrides `logging.level`
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — overrides `credentials.anthropic_api_key`
- `COMPOSER_PORT` — overrides `server.port`
- `COMPOSER_BIND_ADDRESS` — overrides `server.bind_address`

## Development Workflow

When adding a new feature, the typical flow is:
1. Define types in `crates/api-types/` (with `#[derive(TS)]`)
2. Add migration in `crates/db/migrations/`
3. Add DB model methods in `crates/db/src/models/`
4. Implement service logic in `crates/services/src/`
5. Add route handlers in `crates/server/src/routes/`
6. Run `pnpm run generate-types` to sync types to frontend
7. Build React components in `packages/web/src/components/`
8. Add TanStack Query hooks in `packages/web/src/hooks/`

## E2E Tests

Located in `packages/web/e2e/tests/`. Uses Playwright with a test-specific DB (`sqlite:composer_test.db`). Tests run sequentially (1 worker). The Playwright config auto-starts both the Cargo server and Vite dev server.
